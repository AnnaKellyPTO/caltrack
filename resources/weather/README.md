### Weather
There are three weather source files necessary for implementing the Caltrack methods:

1. [CZ2010 weather normals for 86 stations in California](http://www.CalTRACK.org/weather.html)
2. [Mapping of zip codes to weather stations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/impactlab/caltrack/master/resources/weather/stationmapping.csv)
3. [Hourly weather station data pulled from the NOAA ISD weather data using USAF](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)
