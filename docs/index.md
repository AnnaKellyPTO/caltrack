# CalTRACK Technical Documentation

This site represents the official technical documentation for CalTRACK, a set of open methods developed and tested through a multi-stakeholder process for estimating gross savings for residential energy efficiency programs in California.

A full process history and related resources can be found on the [CalTRACK](http://www.caltrack.org) website.

Initial draft requirements for CalTRACK were developed by the CalTRACK technical working group based on methods developed as part of the OpenEEmeter open source platform and tested using data from PG&E to empirically verify assumptions and identify areas of sensitivity, the modify publish official versions of the methods through an open source process. Details about the CalTRACK technical working group processes can be found on the [CalTRACK](http://www.caltrack.org/methods-dev-process.html) website.

Communication for CalTRACK methods development happens primarily through [Github issues](https://github.com/impactlab/caltrack/issues) and using a community communication tool called Slack. The source code for this documentation, as well as results from testing, discussion, and guidance for contribution can be found on the [CalTRACK Github repository](https://github.com/impactlab/caltrack)

[Open Energy Efficiency](http://openeemeter.org)

the Open Energy Efficiency team has provided technical support to the the CalTRACK effort under contract with PG&E since 2013. The core methods were initially defined during the Advnaced Home Upgrade Software Initiative process, then developed into the [OpenEEmeter](http://www.openeemeter.org) open source platform and documentation with support by the California Energy Commission, and finally tested and agreed to through the CalTRACK Beta Process. A history of this effort can be found on the [CalTRACK](http://www.caltrack.org/caltrack-history.html) website.
