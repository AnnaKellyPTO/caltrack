# Welcome to the CalTRACK Technical Documentation

A Shared repository for beta testers of CalTRACK methods

Additional documentation on the CalTRACK process can be found a [caltrack.org](http://caltrack.org).

-----

The CalTRACK Beta Test is intended to help test, refine and finalize the technical requirements and methods for CalTRACK. In it, the initial draft requirements for CalTRACK developed by the technical working group will be tested in the field using data from PG&E to empirically verify assumptions made by the technical working group, identify areas of sensitivity, and agree on a first implementable system. Details about the Beta Test plan can can be found here.

----

Communication for the project will happen primarily on Slack. Any relevant changes to the technical specification outlined in the CalTRACK docs will be discussed and resolved as Github issues on [this repository](https://github.com/impactlab/caltrack)
