# CalTRACK Beta Data Analysis Technical Guidelines

Data Analysis for CalTRACK if focused on producing site-level gross savings estimates by fuel type. Because fuel use data comes in a variety of frequencies and each frequency requires different modeling considerations, CalTRACK analysis will focus on three separate modeling tasks: 

- Gross savings from **monthly** billing data
- Gross savings from **daily** usage data
- Gross savings estimation from **hourly** usage data

Because of data access issues, the beta test will focus first on completing all three modeling tasks for electricity.

The analysis director contains three subdirectories: `/monthly`, `/daily`, `/hourly`. These directories contain READMEs with detailed technical guidance for month, daily, and hourly savings analysis under CalTRACK. Each of these directories will be used by Beta Testers to (optionally) share data analysis code and share testing outputs for the respective type of analysis performed.
