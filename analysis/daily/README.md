# CalTRACK Daily Gross Savings Estimation Technical Guidelines

=======

### Methodological Overview

Site-level Gross Savings using daily billing data (both electricity and gas) will use a two-stage estimation approach that builds on the technical appendix of the Uniform Methods Project for Whole Home Building Analysis and the California Evaluation Project, while providing more specific guidance to ensure replicability and address specific methodological issues related to both the data sources and the CalTRACK-specific use cases that are not addressed in prior standards.

The precise first stage equation for gross savings estimation using daily usage (both gas and electric) data has not been defined by the technical working group.
