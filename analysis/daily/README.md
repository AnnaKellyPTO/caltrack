# CalTrack Daily  Gross Savings Estimation Technical Guidelines

=======

### Methodological Overview


Site-level Gross Savings using daily use data (both electricity and gas) will initially replicate exactly the two-stage HDD+CDD use per day model used with monthly billing data, but using actual use per day. 

#### Two-stage UPD Replication

The two-stage approach fits two separate parametric models to daily energy use data in both the pre-intervention (baseline) period and the post-intervention (reporting) period using the following first stage equation:

### First Stage Equation

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E_%7Bim%7D%20%3D%20%5Cmu_i%20&plus;%5Cbeta_H*H_%7Bim%7D%28%5Ctau_H%29&plus;%5Cbeta_C*C_%7Bim%7D%28%5Ctau_C%29&plus;%5Cepsilon_%7Bim%7D)

In the second stage, using parameter estimates from the first stage, weather normalized savings for both the baseline period and reporting period can be computed by using corresponding temurature normals for the relevant time period (typical year weather normalized gross savings), or by using current-year weather to project forward baseline period use (current year weather normalized gross savings) and differencing between baseline and reporting period estimated use.  


### Technical guidelines for implementing two-stage estimation 
In order to ensure replicability of results, the following steps to two-stage modeling need cleaer and consistent rules:

1. Selecting balance point temperature search for calculating Heating Degree Days (*HDD*) and Cooling Degree Days (*CDD*) for each month.
2. Selecting parameters for inclusion in final site level savings estimation (model selection) 

#### Normalizing Monthly Usage Data to Use Per Day

`monthly_usage_quantity / (bill-end-date - bill_start_date)`

#### Selecting balance point tempuratures for HDD and CDD

Balance point tempuratures will be selected by doing a search over signel paramter HDD and CDD models separately (in sequence) using the following search criteria:

Search range: `60 degrees F to 80 degrees F`
Objective function: `min -R^2`

If `R^2 < .05` after search, the HDD balance point tempurature should default to **65 F** and CDD balance point tempurature should default to **68 F**.


#### Model selection

For each site, the choice must be made between using one of of the single parameter models (Just `HDD` or `CDD`) or combined `HDD` and `CDD` models. This choice is called *model selection*. For CalTrack, model selection will be done by sequential model fit in the following way:

1. Retain parameter estimates and standard errors for both HDD and CDD models from optimal balance point tempurature search.
2. Fit combined `HDD` + `CDD` model.
3. If parameter estimates for combined model all meet minimum stignificance criteria (`p > 0.05`) then the combined model is used. 
4. If one or more of the parameters do not meet the significance criteria, perform an F-test between the combined and the HDD model to ensure multicolinearity isn't causing individual insignificance by joint significance. 
5. If it fails the F-test, then default to the single parameter model that meets the significance test. 
6. If neither the HDD nor the CDD parameters meet the significance test, but the intercept does, use only the intercept (weather independent usage mean for the time period) as the site-level model. 

### Second Stage Estimated Quantities
During the second stage, three savings quantities will be estimated for each site.

1. Cumulative gross savings over entire performance period
2. Normal year annualized gross savings
3. Current year annualized gross savings in current year

## Prepared Summary Statistics for Analysis Comparison

To ensure that the CalTrack analysis specification can produce consistent results, each beta tester will generate a set of summary statistics on each of the above site-level savings estimates that can be shared with the larger group through csvs saved to this repository. There will be one savings summary file generated by each Beta Tester. Each file will be a .csv and will have the following general format:

| Summary Stat | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Number of Sites Included in Analysis | 4321 |
| Number of sites that met model fitnes criteria | 3800 |
| Min cumulative gross savings | 123 |
| Max cumulative gross savings| 456|
