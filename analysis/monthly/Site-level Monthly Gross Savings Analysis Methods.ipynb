      "## CalTrack Monthly Gross Savings Estimation Technical Guideline\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodological Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Site-level gross savings using monthly billing data (both electricity and gas) will use a two-stage estimation approach that closely follows the technical appendix of the Uniform Methods Project for Whole Home Building Analysis and the California Evaluation Project, with some modifications and more specific guidance developed through empirical testing to ensure consistency and replicability of results.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two-stage approach first fits **two** separate parametric models to daily average energy use, on the pre-intervention (baseline) period and one in the post-intervention (reporting) period for a single site using an ordinary least squares regression of the form:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$UPD_{mi} = \\mu_i + \\beta_{Hi}H_m + \\beta_{Ci}C_m +  \\epsilon_{mi} $$\n",
      "\n",
      "Where \n",
      "\n",
      "$UPD_{mi}$ is average use (gas in therms, electricity in kWh) per day in month `m` for site `i`.\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\mu_i$ is the mean use for site `i`, or intercept.\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\beta_{Hi}$ is the coefficient site `i` on average heating degree days per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\beta_{Ci}$ is the coefficient or site `i` on average cooling degree days per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "$H_m$ is the average number of heating degree days per day in month `m`, which is a function of a fixed base temperature, the average daily temperatures from the weather station matched to site `i` during month `m`, and the number of days in month `m` with matched usage and weather data for site `i`.\n",
      "\n",
      "$C_m$ is the average number of cooling degree days per day in month `m`, which is a function of a selected base temperature, the average daily temperatures from the weather station matched to site `i` during month `m`, and the number of days in month `m` with matched usage and weather data for site `i`.\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\epsilon_{mi}$ is the site specific error term for a given month.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second stage, using parameter estimates from the first stage equation, weather normalized savings for both the baseline period and reporting period can be computed by using corresponding temperature normals for the relevant time period (typical year weather normalized gross savings), or by using current-year weather to project forward baseline period use (current year weather normalized gross savings) and differencing between baseline and reporting period estimated or actual use, depending on the quantity of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "###Technical guidelines for implementing two-stage estimation on monthly electric and gas usage data\n",
      "\n",
      "Caltrack savings estimation begins with gas and electric usage data, project data, and weather data that have been cleaned and combined according to the Data Cleaning and Integration tecnical specification. Starting with the prepared data, site-level monthly gross savings analysis is performed by implmenting the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Generate Use Per Day values and separate usage data into a pre- and a post-intervention data series\n",
      "\n",
      "The CalTrack monthly gross savings analysis uses average use per day ($UPD$) values for each month  by either using mon**summing daily use to monthly total use** by **calendar month**, then divide by the number of days in that month that had usage values, as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "$UPD_m = \\frac{1}{n_{U_d}}*\\sum{U_d}$\n",
      "\n",
      "Where\n",
      "\n",
      "$UPD_m$ is the average use per day for a given month `m`\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\sum{U_d}$ is the sum of all daily use values $U_d$ for a given month `m\u2019\n",
      "\n",
      "$n_{U_d}$ is the total number of daily use values provided in the usage series that are between the first calendar day of month `m` and the last calendar day of month `m` \n",
      "\n",
      "*Note: If daily use data for gas or electric is not available, monthly billing data can be used for the monthly billing analysis. However, modifications of the denominators for avergage use per day and for average HDD and CDD per day are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now split the series of $UPD_m$ values into pre- and post-intervention periods according to the following rules:\n",
      "\n",
      "*Pre-intervention period*: all full month (15 days of recorded use or more) $UPD_m$ values from the beginning of the series up to the the complete calendar month prior to the `work_start_date`. The month containing `work_start_date` is excluded from this series.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Post-intervention period*: all full month (15 days of recorded use or more) values from the first complete calendar month after the `work_end_date` to the end of the series. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Final data sufficiency qualification check**: All qualifying sites must have at least 12 months of contiguous $UPD_m$ values in the pre-intervention series and at least 12 months of contiguous post-intervention $UPD_m$ values starting with the month after `work_end_date`. \n",
      "\n",
      "**All sites not meeting these minimum data requirements are thrown out of the analysis**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Set fixed degree day base temperature and calculated HDD and CDD\n",
      "\n",
      "Next you calculate total HDD and CDD for the each calendar month in the series. CalTrack will use a fixed degree day base for monthly billing analysis. The following balance point temperatures will be use:\n",
      "\n",
      "HDD base temp: 60 F \n",
      "\n",
      "CDD base temp: 70 F\n",
      "\n",
      "HDD and CDD values are calculated as follows\n",
      "\n",
      "$HDD_m = \\frac{1}{n_{U_d}}*\\sum{ \\max(60 - T_{ave}, 0) }$\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Where \n",
      "\n",
      "$HDD_m$ = Average heating degree days per day for calendar month `m`\n",
      "\n",
      "$n_{U_d}$ = the number of days with both weather and usage data\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\sum$ = the sum of the degree  over each day `d` in calendar month `m`\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\max$ = the maximum of the two values in ()\n",
      "\n",
      "$T_{ave}$ = the average temperature for day `d`\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And\n",
      "\n",
      "$CDD_m = \\frac{1}{n_{U_d}}*\\sum{ max(ave_temp_d - 70, 0) }$\n",
      "\n",
      "Where \n",
      "\n",
      "&CDD_m$ = Cooling degree days for calendar month `m`\n",

      "#### 3. Fit All Candidate Models and Apply Qualification Criteria\n",
      "\n",
      "For each site, all allowable models will be run as candidate models and then have minimum fitness criteria set for qualification.\n",
      "\n",
      "For CalTrack electric monthly savings analysis, the following candidate models are fit:\n",

      "$\\beta_{C} > 0$\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\mu_i > 0$\n",
      "\n",
      "For electric, qualifying models for selection must have each parameter estimate meet the minimum significance criteria of $p < 0.1$ and are strictly positive. All qualifying models are considered for final model selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "For CalTrack gas monthly savings analysis, the following candidate models are fit:\n",
      "\n",

      "$\\beta_{H} > 0$\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\mu_i > 0$\n",
      "\n",
      "If each parameter estimate meets minimum significance criteria (p < 0.1) and are strictly positive, then the model is a qualifying model for inclusion in model selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Select the best for pre-intervenion and post-intervention periods for use in second-stage savings estimation \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All qualifying pre-intervention models are compared to each other and among qualifying models, the model with the maximum adjusted R-squared will be selected for second-stage savings estimation.\n",
