NOTE: THIS FILE DOES NOT CONTAIN STATISTICS TO COMPARE WITH OTHER BETA TEST PARTICIPANTS
This summary file is generated to show statistics for a simple approach to estimating bias in our savings estimates.
To determine the bias we changed work start and end dates from the projects list to be one year earlier than they 
actually occured - then re-ran the same savings estimation pipeline that is outlined in the analysis README.  Therefore
pretreatment and posttreatment models were trained on usage data that was always in the [actual] pretreatment time
period.  Cumulative gross savings stats and year two annualized savings stats below should be disregarded (because
usage data for those periods includes actual post-treatment usage).
