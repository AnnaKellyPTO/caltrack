CalTRACK Technical Documentation
================================

CalTRACK methods are developed in an open and transparent stakeholder process that uses empirical testing to define replicable methods for calculating normalized metered energy consumption using either monthly or interval data from an existing conditions baseline.

This repository contains the CalTRACK 2.0 methods, and the CalTRACK Methodological Appendix, which explains how many of the methods were developed.
