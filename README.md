# CalTRACK Technical Documentation

This site represents the official technical documentation for CalTRACK, a set of open methods developed and tested through a multi-stakeholder process for estimating gross savings for residential energy efficiency programs in California.

Initial draft requirements for CalTRACK were developed by the CalTRACK technical working group and tested using data from PG&E to empirically verify assumptions and identify areas of sensitivity, the modify publish official versions of the methods through an open source process. 

Communication for CalTRACK methods development happens primarily through [Github issues](https://github.com/impactlab/caltrack/issues) and using a community communication tool called Slack. The documentation, as well as results from testing, discussion, and guidance for contribution can be found on the [CalTRACK Github repository](https://github.com/impactlab/caltrack)

[Open Energy Efficiency](http://openeemeter.org)

The Open Energy Efficiency team has provided technical support to the the CalTRACK effort under contract with PG&E since 2012. The core methods that became CalTRACK were initially defined during the Advanced Home Upgrade Software Initiative process, then developed into the OpenEEmeter open source code with support of the California Energy Commission. These methods were then further refined and tested in the final beta phase of this effort, resulting in the CalTRACK v1.0 Methods.
