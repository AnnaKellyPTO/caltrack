# CalTRACK Methods Repository

A shared repository for the discussion, testing, and publication of CalTRACK methods

-----

The CalTRACK open source repository is intended to facilitate the discussion, testing, refining and final publication of the technical requirements and methods for CalTRACK. Initial draft requirements for CalTRACK developed by the technical working group are tested using data from PG&E to empirically verify assumptions made by the technical working group, identify areas of sensitivity, and agree on publishable versions of the methods. Details about the CalTRACK technical working group processes can be found [here](http://www.caltrack.org/methods-dev-process.html).

This repository is organized for sharing methods documentation as well as sharing data, code, and outputs from empirical tests of the methods.

The repository is structured as follows:

``/docs`` contains Markdown files for publishing the official CalTRACK technical specification, guidance, and methods, which are published at [docs.caltrack.org](http://docs.caltrack.org).

``/tests`` contains detailed documentation, code, and results from empirical test of various versions of the CalTRACK methods by CalTRACK methods testers.

----

Communication among committers and community members happens primarily through github issues on this repository, as well as through a CalTRACK Slack organization. Any suggestions and modifications to the methods are handled through an open source development process.
