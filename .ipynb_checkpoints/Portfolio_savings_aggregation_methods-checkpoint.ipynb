      "# Technical Specification for Aggregating Site-level Gross Savings and Quantifying Uncertainty in Aggregate Savings Statistics\n",
      "\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of CalTrack is to develop replicable, consistent, and methodologically defensible estimators of savings over **portfolios of homes**. \n",
      "\n",
      "Portfolio-level savings statistics are based on aggregations of site-level savings gross savings estimates created using the CalTrack site-level monthly gross savings analysis methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because all site-level savings quantities generated using CalTrack's technical specifications are based on time series predictions, portfolio-level savings statistics primarily use prediction errors to estimate of site-level uncertainty, and calculate portfolio-level averages using inverse variance weighted means to get a consistent estimator of mean portfolio-level savings.\n",

      "## Monthly Savings Estimate Aggregation Procedure\n",

      "M & V standards for industrial savings estimation, which has been dealing with AMI data longer, provides useful guidance for dealing with these two considerations. Following ASHRAE Guideline 14-2002, and augmenting work done by the NW SEM Collaborative, we propose the following method:\n",

      "##### Fractional Savings uncertainty calculation\n",
      "\n",
      "Because variances are larger in larger homes, normalizing levels of uncertainty using fractional savings uncertainty is an important aggregate metric, both for model comparison and selection, as well as final output. CalTrack will compute the Fractional Savings Uncertainty at the site level based on the following equation:\n",

      "\n",
      "While the technical working group acknowledged the potential use of comparison groups in gross savings estimation to correct for population-wide exogenous effects on use, after extensive debate, it was decided that the CalTrack use cases (pay-for-performance in particular) required the ability for non-utility actors to be able to estimate savings without access to comparison group data. While several promising ideas were developed through the technical working group process about how to address this issue (utilities publishing public adjustment factors based on pre-tabilated comparison groups for example), there were serious concern about feasbility in time for early 2017 roll out of the P4P pilot. As a result, the issue of transparent and replicable comparison group adjustments as part of CalTrack methods was left for the next version of CalTrack technical specifications.\n",
